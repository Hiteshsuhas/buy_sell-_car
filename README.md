# buy_sell-_car
A car buy/sell system is an innovative project that provides an effective solution for the users in finding the correct second-hand car as per current market value and users to post their car ads. Now-a-days, a lot of classified websites allow people to post their used cars only. A buyer at this time does not know the real value of the car and may get fooled. So our system requires the seller to enter car details such as car manufacturing year, model, engine condition, accident/repairs, paint condition and many other factors. Based on these values our algorithm calculates the most accurate value for the car. These factors need to be verified at the time of buying the car. Thus, our system allows users to buy sell cars.
Automobiles is the human transport sources. It is necessary them to update to the today’s technology. Used cars are one of the great things for the low budget people. This application is used to help them to buy car according to people’s choice. This system uses the Robust algorithms which focuses on handling unexpected termination and unexpected actions. It requires code to handle these terminations and actions gracefully by displaying accurate and unambiguous error messages. These error messages allow the user to more easily debug the program.
